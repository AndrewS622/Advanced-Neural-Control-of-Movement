# Advanced-Neural-Control-of-Movement
ES 249 at Harvard University

Engineering Sciences 249 examined the biomechanical and neural bases of movement. Problem sets and a graduate-level final project examined these factors from mathematical and computational perspectives, primarily through the use of Matlab. Code and submissions are contained in this repo. The assignments are as follows: 

1. Forward and Inverse Kinematics
2. Summation of Twitch Responses, Minimization of the Cumulative Squared Jerk, Acceleration, and Snap Using the Calculus of Variations
3. Minimum Jerk Approximation via Gradient Descent, The Brachistochrone Problem, and Exploration of the Hodgkin-Huxley Model
4. Backpropagation and Function Approximation in Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Error-Dependent Learning Models
5. (Project) Calculation of Joint Torques, Influence of Force Fields, Stiffness, and Viscosity
